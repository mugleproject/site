## RFC process

Mugle's [Request For Comments (RFC) process↗](https://github.com/mugleproject/mugle-rfcs/blob/master/text/0001-rfc-process.md) provides a consistent and controlled path for introducing substantial improvements. Smaller changes, such as bug fixes and documentation improvements, can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow. Major or complex changes benefit from a more formalized process to build consensus among Mugle's community participants.

The [mugle-rfcs repo↗](https://github.com/mugleproject/mugle-rfcs) contains all active RFCs.
